## The Mystery of the Negative Thinker

Sherlock Holmes and his trusted companion, Dr. Watson, had been called to investigate a baffling case. A wealthy businessman, Mr. James, had fallen ill and suffered from a series of financial setbacks, despite being in good health and having a successful business. 

As soon as they arrived at his mansion, Holmes immediately noticed the negative energy and attitude exuding from Mr. James. His pessimistic mindset was evident in every conversation, thought and action. 

Suspecting a link between James' negative mindset and his financial and health troubles, Holmes decided to delve deeper and solve the mystery.

"Dr. Watson, I believe Mr. James' consistent negative thoughts and energy are attracting negative circumstances and outcomes. A positive mindset is key to attracting success and promoting good health," said Holmes.

To prove his theory, Holmes conducted an experiment where he placed two plants side by side, one with positive affirmations and the other with negative statements. The plant with positive affirmations thrived while the one with negative statements wilted and died.

Holmes then reminded James of the power of his thoughts and the importance of cultivating a positive mindset to attract success and good health. With Holmes' guidance, James began to develop a more positive outlook on life, focusing on solutions rather than problems. 

One year later, Holmes and Watson received a letter from an even more successful and healthier Mr. James, thanking them for their guidance and teachings on the power of positive thinking. 

The mystery was solved, and Holmes had once again proven the importance of cultivating a positive mindset to attract success and vitality in life.

## The Code 

```
def cultivate_positive_mindset():
  thoughts = input("What thoughts do you entertain daily? ")
  if "negative" in thoughts:
    thoughts = positive_affirmations
  return thoughts
  
def attract_success():
  mindset = cultivate_positive_mindset()
  if "successful" not in mindset:
    mindset += " I attract success."
  return mindset
  
mr_james_mindset = attract_success()

``` 

By using the `cultivate_positive_mindset()` function, we ensure that our thoughts are geared towards positivity. The `attract_success()` function then adds the affirmation of attracting success to our mindset if it was not already present.

The code essentially emphasizes the importance of training our minds to attract success and opportunities by adopting a positive outlook on life.
# Explanation of the Code

The code used in this chapter demonstrates the importance of cultivating a positive mindset to attract success and vitality in life. 

Here's a breakdown of the code and how it solves the mystery:

```
def cultivate_positive_mindset():
  thoughts = input("What thoughts do you entertain daily? ")
  if "negative" in thoughts:
    thoughts = positive_affirmations
  return thoughts
```

The `cultivate_positive_mindset()` function prompts the user to input the thoughts they entertain daily. The code then checks if there are any negative thoughts in the input. If negative thoughts are found, they are replaced with positive affirmations to help cultivate a more positive mindset. 

```
def attract_success():
  mindset = cultivate_positive_mindset()
  if "successful" not in mindset:
    mindset += " I attract success."
  return mindset
```

The `attract_success()` function calls the `cultivate_positive_mindset()` function and sets its return value to the `mindset` variable. 

If the string "successful" is not found in `mindset`, then the code adds the affirmation "I attract success." to the `mindset` variable. 

```
mr_james_mindset = attract_success()
```

Finally, the code creates a variable called `mr_james_mindset` and sets its value to the result of calling the `attract_success()` function. This allows Mr. James (our subject from the mystery) to use the code to develop a more positive mindset and attract success into his life.

In summary, the code solves the mystery by demonstrating how important it is to develop a positive mindset to attract success in life. By asking users to input their daily thoughts and replacing negative thoughts with positive affirmations, the code helps cultivate a positive mindset. The code then adds the affirmation of attracting success to the mindset to further strengthen its positivity.
